Welcome! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at **Texas Tech University**, working in the Computational Intelligence, Control, and Information Lab (CIÂ²) under the supervision of [Dr. Stas Tiomkin](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/cs/faculty/Stas_tiomkin/stastiomkin.php).

My research focuses on **intrinsic motivation in dynamical systems**, with applications in **multi-agent coordination**, **robotics**, and **generative modeling**. I'm especially interested in how principles from control theory, information theory, and learning can guide intelligent behavior in uncertain, high-dimensional environments.

## ðŸ“œ Background

I'm currently supported by the prestigious **Koh Family Doctoral Fellowship**, awarded to two PhD Students in the Whitacre Collage of Engineering.

Iâ€™ve also worked with NASA to support the development of urban air mobility systems using generative AI.
